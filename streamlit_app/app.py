        "- **Distinct Patients Count** ‚Äì Fraudulent providers often bill many unique patients. A large patient base with frequent claims could signal a broad fraud scheme (e.g., billing for patients not actually seen).\n"
        "- **Average Patient Age** ‚Äì A lower average age of patients can increase fraud risk in this model. This might indicate targeting of relatively healthier or younger individuals for unnecessary services, whereas legitimate providers might have older patients on average.\n"

        "To illustrate the potential savings: suppose fraudulent providers in a year generated $100 million in false claims. "

        "At **80% precision**, some legitimate providers might be investigated unnecessarily (about 1 in 5 flagged are false alarms), but the vast majority of flagged cases are actual fraud. "
        "In our dataset, for example, known fraudulent providers billed roughly **$295 million** in total; this model could have helped recover approximately **$250 million** of that. "
        "These numbers underscore a strong return on investment: by integrating the model into the fraud review process, insurers can significantly **reduce losses** and deter fraudulent behavior."
